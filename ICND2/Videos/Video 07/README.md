- **Description:**

```
Because Spanning-Tree Protocol (STP) is on and works fairly well by
default, most engineers don't spend time to learn about it, much to
the detriment of their network environment. In this Nugget, Jeremy
talks about the benefits of switch redundancy, broadcast storms and
how STP works, including root bridge election, port selection and
convergence.
