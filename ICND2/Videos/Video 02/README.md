- **[Notes](notes.md)**
- **Exercise Answers (No Exercises for this Video)**
- **Description:**

```
As ICND2 builds directly on the foundation of ICND1, it will serve you
well to have an ICND1 cram session. For the next five Nuggets, join
Jeremy as he walks through a lab that covers most of the core concepts
of the ICND1 course. In this Nugget, the focus is on the base
configuration (hostname, passwords, console port configuration, logon
banners, etc.).
