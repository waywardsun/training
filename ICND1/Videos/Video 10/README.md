- **Description:**

```
If this were a Microsoft course, this Nugget would be called, "Working with 
Windows." Yes, that's how important the Internetwork Operating System (IOS) is 
to Cisco, a self-proclaimed SOFTWARE company rather than hardware! Jeremy helps 
familiarize you with the Cisco IOS by illustrating context-sensitive help, basic 
commands, and the configuration modes. As a bonus, the first five minutes of 
this video explains how to get a job in the Cisco world... while sick!
