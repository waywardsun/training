- **[Notes](notes.md)**
- **Exercise Answers (No Exercises for this Video)**
- **Description:**

```
OK, here's where you really get to DO something! By time you complete this 
Nugget, you will know how to configure an out-of-the-box piece of Cisco gear by 
using a console connection. In order to do this, you will learn about rollover 
cables, serial port settings, and terminal emulators (Putty, Tera Term, 
SecureCRT, Minicom, etc...). And no, CBT Nuggets does not endorse "hit the red 
button" in your IT room.
