- **[Notes](notes.md)**
- **Exercise Answers (No Exercises for this Video)**
- **Description:**

```
It's the final form of subnetting! The good news is this: Variable Length Subnet 
Masking (VLSM) does not introduce any radically new subnet concepts. Rather, it 
uses combinations of concepts you already know! By time you're done with this 
Nugget, you will have seen nearly every subnetting possibility in the current IP 
protocol.
