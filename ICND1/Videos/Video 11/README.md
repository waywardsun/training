- **Description:**

```
Cisco switches work just like any other switch from the minute you pull them out 
of the box and plug them in...but if you wanted Cisco switches to work "like any 
other switch," why would you buy Cisco? In this Nugget, Jeremy walks through the 
base configuration of a switch including hostname configuration, negating 
commands, and setting console, telnet, and enable passwords. In addition, Jeremy 
adds information on understanding the physical cabling, moving from the wall 
jack to the patch panel to the switch itself.
