- **Description:**

```
Static Routing is POWERFUL. SO powerful, in fact, that Cisco bans you from using 
it on the CCIE certification exam!! Why? Because you can accomplish just about 
anything with it given the time. Static routing allows you to manually "educate" 
your router on the network locations it can reach. Jeremy walks through the 
concepts and configuration behind static routing.
