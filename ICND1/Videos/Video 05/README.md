- **[Notes](notes.md)**
- **Exercise Answers (No Exercises for this Video)**
- **Description:**

```
While the initial "Basic IP Addressing" Nugget delivered the essence of network 
communication, there are many details that need to be unpacked! Jeremy designed 
this Nugget to fill in those gaps by discussing static and dynamic addressing 
(and a bonus: DHCP Relay), public and private addressing, classes of network 
addresses, communication types (unicast, multicast, broadcast), and Classful vs. 
Classless addressing.
