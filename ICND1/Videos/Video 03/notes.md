# Video 03 Notes

## OSI Model
- **What is the OSI Model?**
  - A standardized architecture defining network communication
  - A system to "break down" network communication
  - A standard to create standards
  - A competing protocol to TCP/IP
    - OSI Protocol, not OSI Model
    - Model was made to describe the protocol
    - TCP/IP won the protocol wars

- **OSI Layers**
  - 7 Layers
    - 7. Application
    - 6. Presentation
    - 5. Session
    - 4. Transport
    - 3. Network
    - 2. Datalink
    - 1. Physical
  - Top 3 Layers
    - Application, Presentation, Session
    - Occur before data leaves the computer
    - Network devices generally don't care about these layers
  - Bottom 4 Layers
    - Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical
    - Network devices mainly focus on these layers
  - Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away

- **Application Layer**
  - Provides network access to network-aware applications
  - Examples: WoW, Counter-Strike, Firefox

- **Presentation Layer**
  - Converts data into well-known formats
  - Examples: HTML, JSON, JPG

- **Session Layer**
  - Creates and maintains sessions
  - Examples: OSI protocol suite session-layer protocol

- **Transport Layer**
  - Defines how data is sent across the network
  - Application separation (Ports)
  - Examples: TCP, UDP

- **Network Layer**
  - Logical Addressing
  - Tells where to send data across a WAN
  - Examples: IP, IPv6

- **Datalink Layer**
  - Physical Addressing
  - Tells where to send data across a LAN
  - Examples: MAC

- **Physical Layer**
  - Actual bits on the wire
  - Examples: Ethernet
