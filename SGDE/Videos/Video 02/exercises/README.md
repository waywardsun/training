#### Q1\. What is the output of ```info  files``` in GDB?

```
According to the gdb documentation:

    'info files' and 'info target' are synonymous; both print the current target 
including the names of the executable and core dump files currently in use by
GDB, and the files from which symbols were loaded. In addition to this, the 
'info files' command lists all the sections and their addresses.
```
